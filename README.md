## 📌 Overview
This project solves the "pricing uncertainty" problem for online sellers by providing an instant price estimate based on product images. By analyzing 129 key visual features, the model suggests a price that aligns with historical market data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Web UI)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)
- **Image Processing:** PIL (Pillow), NumPy
- **Deployment:** [Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face]

## 🧠 Model & Approach
- **Data Transformation:** Images are resized to 224x224 and normalized to ensure consistent feature weight.
- **Dimensionality:** The model processes a flattened feature vector to map visual patterns to a continuous price variable.
- **Accuracy:** Optimized for rapid inference, making it suitable for real-time mobile/web deployment.
